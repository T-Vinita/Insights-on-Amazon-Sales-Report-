## 🧐 What is Fraud Detection?

Fraud detection is the process of identifying illegal or suspicious activities—such as fake orders, returns abuse, or payment manipulation—within sales data. In e-commerce, catching fraud early protects both the business and its customers.

# Fit model
model = IsolationForest(contamination=0.02)
df['fraud_flag'] = model.fit_predict(df[['order_amount', 'order_frequency']])

# Interactive visualization (see notebook for more!)
```
